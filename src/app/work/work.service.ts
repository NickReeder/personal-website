      <br>
      <br>
      The first was an internal admin app that overhauled Project Management and Customer Reletaions Management. This was a complete end to end development with Power Apps and Power Automate that transitioned the old process of updating an Power Point and managing tactical sales by email
      and tranistioned them to a live power app and connected MS Dataverse Database
      <br>
      <br>      
      The second effort I supported was a process overhaul for Air Combat Command's (ACC) A5W Weather System Requirments system. This effort is ongoing..`,

      description: `Worked on a team that developed a readiness analytics tool focusing on both current and predictive  readiness across five domains: Equipment, Consumables, Human-capitol, Ordnance, and Squadron training (ECHOS). While on this project I utilized Python, SQL, and Databricks to modernize the data pipeline, converting 3 years of isolated Tableau Prep Flows to efficient and automated Python Scripts and a relational database. I additionally developed predictive analytics and machine learning across multiple domains and set up code reviews/audits. 
	Pitched and prototyped cross-domain models such as Generative SQL for custom database querying, Schedule Optimizers, Component Survival Analysis. 
  <br>
  <br>
Built a Power App to solve the team's biggest data challenge: pilot training qualifications. This app was designed to take hundreds of inaccessible training documents, convert them to a computer readable format, and store them in an CAC protected database. This app was initially implemented for a subset of 30 combat and non-combat units. After meeting with stakeholders and reviewing feedback, client intended to expand command wide.
